## Help me building a Python-only accurate multirotor simulator !

**Tired of C++ bullshit, gazebo, ROS while you just want to fly a drone ?**


Let's build the metadrive of drones https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive

Goals:
- accurate physical simulation
- multiple drones
- 3d rendering
- keyboard controller, real radiocommand or xbox 360 controller, or custom guidance
- Betaflight SITL integration
